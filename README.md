<p>Members of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/">OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC</a> create and manage technical content in this TC GitHub repository ( <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-cap">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-cap</a> ) as part of the TC's chartered work (<i>i.e.</i>, the program of work and deliverables described in its <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/charter.php">charter</a>).</p>

<p>OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work">GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work</a>, are governed by the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process">TC Process</a>, <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr">IPR Policy</a>, and other policies, similar to TC Wikis, TC JIRA issues tracking instances, TC SVN/Subversion repositories, etc.  While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these TC GitHub repositories are distinct from <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories">OASIS TC Open Repositories</a>, which are used for development of open source <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses">licensed</a> content.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The purpose of this repository is to support collaborative development of OpenC2 custom actuator profiles by TC members.</p>

<p>The current (2018-06) draft language specification for OpenC2 allows for actuator profiles other than those that are OASIS specifications. It allows for "extensions" by vendors or users.  This openc2-cap GitHub repository is intended for use by those TC members who want to work collaboratively on their "custom" profiles.  'Cap' &mdash; is for 'custom actuator profile'.</p>

<p>The qualifier "custom" is used to distinguish between actuator profiles being drafted as OASIS Specifications and those "custom" profiles being developed as extensions to a specification (<i>e.g.</i>, providing vendor-specific or user-specific options) or to support a particular technology that does not yet have a specification.</p>

<p>The work on OpenC2 actuator profile specifications by TC members would not be a goal for this <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-cap/">openc2-cap</a> repository, but the custom profiles in the repository may serve to inform the actuator profile specifications.</p>
