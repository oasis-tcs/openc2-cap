## Abstract
Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language
to enable the command and control of cyber defense components,
subsystems and/or systems in a manner
that is agnostic of the underlying products,
technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation.
Actuator profiles specify the subset of the optional language components
that the actuator will respond to.
This Custom Actuator Profile (CAP) is for a  fancier'hello world'
actuator than haha (Https Api Hello-world Actuator)
so it's the haga (Https Api Global-welcome Actuator)
since "Global Welcome" is one step up from "Hello World".
Haga exists just for the purpose of demonstrating
the language/profile/transport with the simplest possible
actuator that implements every language component at least once.
I.e. it accepts each action, each target, each argument - but with
the minimum number of combinations.
Haga also serves as a template for 'real' actuators.

Haga was implemented on beam,
a highly reliable erlang/elixir virtual machine.
Several implementations exist (or will) - see (put link here).

# 1 Introduction
Haga stands for Https Api Global-Welcome Actuator.
Haga exists just for the purpose of demonstrating
the language/profile/transport with the simplest possible
actuator that touches each command field. Haga also serves as a template for 'real' actuators

## 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to:

* Define a profile for the custom extensions to the haga profile for operation with haga instantiation(s).
* Specify all OpenC2 ACTIONS implemented.
* Specify all OpenC2 TARGETS implemented.
* Specify all OpenC2 TARGET_SPECIFIERS implemented.
* Specify all OpenC2 ARGS implemented.
* Specify the valid command semantics e.g. what combinations of ACTONS/TARGET/TARGET_SPECIFIERS/ARGS are valid.
* Specify the abstract schema for the command consumer

This haga profile:

* Does not define or implement ACTIONS beyond those defined in Version 1.0 of the Language Specification.
* Is conformant with version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification as it existed in CSD04 (ref).

Cyber defense systems that are utilizing OpenC2 MAY require the following components to implement the SLPF  profile:

* OpenC2 Producers: Devices that send commands, receive responses, and manage the execution of commands involving one or more haga's or other actuators with haga capability. The OpenC2 producer needs _a priori_ knowledge of which commands the actuator can process and execute, therefore must understand the profiles for any device that it intends to command.
* Devices that receive OpenC2 commands and implement the haga profile. Generally these are actuators but could be orchestrators.
* An Openc2 Consumer may provide multiple cyber defense mechanisms including haga functionality as a subset of its capabilities, thus must implement the SLPF  profile.

## 1.2 Terminology
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this specification are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

## 1.3 Document Conventions
The following typographical conventions are used in this document.

_italics_

Indicates new terms, URLs, email addresses, filenames, and file extensions.

ALL CAPS

Used for components of the abstract syntax: ACTION, TARGET, ACTUATOR, OPTIONS.

'single quotes'

Used for single actions or commands (i.e. action target pairs)

# 2 OpenC2 Language Binding
This section defines the set of ACTIONS, TARGETS, SPECIFIERS and ARGUMENTS that are meaningful
in the context of haga's. This section also describes the format of the RESPONSE frame's status
and results field. This section organized into three major subsections; Components, Response and Commands.

An OpenC2 command consists of an ACTION/TARGET pair and associated specifiers and arguments.
This section will enumerate the allowed commands,
identify which are required and present the associated responses.

## 2.1 OpenC2 Components
The components of an OpenC2 command include ID, ACTIONS, TARGETS, ACTUATOR and associated
ARGUMENTS and SPECIFIERS which were defined independently.
Appropriate aggregation of the components will define a command-body
that is meaningful in the context of a haga.

The components of an OpenC2 command include:

* ID: The ID as specified in the OpenC2 Language Specifiction
* ACTIONS:   The subset of the ACTIONS defined in the OpenC2 Language specification.
    * This profiles does not define ACTIONS that are external to Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification.
* TARGETS:   The subset of the TARGETs and target-specifiers defined in the Language specification that are meaningful in the context of haga, and the TARGET and target-specifiers extensions that are defined in this specification.
* ARGUMENTS: For haga as defined in this CAP, the ARGUMENTS field is unused.
* ACTUATOR:  For haga as defined in this CAP, the ACTUATOR field is unused (direct connection only so the consumer and producer are mutually identified and authenticated via the transport).

### 2.1.1 ID
The command ID is REQUIRED.

### 2.1.2 Actions
Table 1 presents the OpenC2 actions that are meaningful
in the context of a haga and identifies
which actions are required for at least one target type.
The particular action/ target pairs
that are required are presented in section XXX.

**Table 1. haga Actions**

| Action | Description | Req/ Opt |
|:---|:---|:---|
| query | The query action initiates a single request for information. Used to communicate the supported options and determine the state or settings of the .  | Required  |

### 2.1.3 Targets
Table 2 lists the TARGETs that are applicable to haga's
and identifies the which target types are required for at least one action/target pair.

**Table 2. Target Data Model Applicable to haga's**

| Target | Description/Notes | Req/Opt |
|:---|:---|:---|
| openc2 | Used to determine the profile(s), schema, and imported targets supported by the actuator  | Required |
| x_hello | "Hello" of "Hello World".  This is an extension target type defined in this specification.  | Required |

### 2.1.4 Command Arguments
Arguments provide additional precision to a command by including information
such as how, when or where a command is to be executed.
This trivially simple actuator uses no command arguments.

## 2.2 Actuator data model
This section defines the data model for the profile.
The ACTUATOR field within an OpenC2 message command is identified
with the actuator profile, and this section defines the actuator-specifiers
and actuator-arguments needed for additional precision.
For this trivially simple actuator, the ACTUATOR field is unused.
Identification and Authentication will be achieved thru the transport.

Note that although the ACTUATOR field is not used in the command,
the actuator itself exists and has this profile - it's just not included
in the command since it can be inferred.

## 2.5 OpenC2 Responses
Response messages originate from the actuator as a response to a command.

The status codes presented in Table 6 apply to all actions and identifies which responses are required to implement for at least one command.

The formats and what is expected in the response for specific commands will be captured in section 2.3 and examples will be provided in section 5, Appendix A. Responses associated with required actions MUST be implemented. Implementations that include optional actions MUST implement the Responses associated with the implemented action.

**Table 6. Response Codes**

| Status Code | Status Text | Req/Opt |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 200 | OK | Required |
| 400 | Unable to process command, parsing error | Required |
| 500 | Server Error | Optional |

## 2.6 OpenC2 Commands
An OpenC2 command consists of an ACTION/TARGET pair and associated specifiers and arguments.  This section will enumerate the allowed commands, identify which are required and present the associated responses.

### 2.6.5 âQueryâ
The valid target types, associated specifiers, and options are summarized in sections 2.2.3.1 through 2.2.3.2.  Sample commands are presented in Section 5 appendix A.

### 2.6.6 âQuery openc2â
The âquery openc2â command is used to determine the capabilities of the actuator.  SLPF s MUST implement the âquery openc2â command. The specifiers for the openc2 target type are summarized in table 10.

**Table 10. Specifiers for the openc2 target type**

| Specifier | Implement | Type | Values/Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| version | Required | number | 1.0/  Version of the Language specification supported by this profile |
| profiles | Required | array | A two by n array where:<br>[0,i] = name of the profile supported<br>[1, i]= full path where the schema resides<br>âStateless-packet-filteringâ MUST be included in the list.  |
| profile-options | Required | array | A three by n array where:<br>[0, i] = "stateless-packet-filtering"<br>[1,i] = action target pair supported. If empty, the option identified applies to all action target pairs<br>[2,i]= option supported for the identified action target pair |
| serialization | Required | list | MUST include âjsonâ.  MAY include other serializations that are validated against the abstract schema presented in appendix B |
| product | Optional | string | The particular vendor product or image such as iptables, amazon, azure etc |

Products that send the âquery openc2â command:

* MUST populate the command options field with âresponse-type="completeâ â.
* MUST populate the command-id.
* MAY populate the respond-to option.
* MUST NOT include other command arguments.
* MAY include one or more of the openc2 specifiers identified in table 2.2.1.1.

Products that receive the âquery openc2â command:

* That cannot parse or process the query openc2 command MUST respond with response code 400.
* Upon successful parsing and processing of the query openc2 command, products MUST respond with response code 200. The results field MUST be populated with the openc2 target type and associated specifiers identified in the command.
* If no specifiers were identified in the openc2 command, then the results field MUST contain all of the specifiers identified in Table 10.  Refer to section 4 for sample commands.

### 2.6.7 âQuery x_helloâ
The âquery x_helloâ command is the "Hello World" raison d'etre of the actuator.
Implementation of the âquery x_helloâ command is REQUIRED.
The x_hello target is defined in this specification. Response to the x_hello query is "World".

#### 2.6.7.1 Type Name: x_hello
Base Type: String


* MUST populate the command options field with âresponse-type="completeâ.
* MUST populate the command-id.
* MAY populate the respond-to argument.
* MUST NOT include other command arguments.
* MAY include one or more of the ap-slpf-query specifiers identified in table 2.2.1.2.

Products that receive  the âquery ap-slpfâ command:

* MUST respond with response code 400 if the command cannot be parsed or processed.
* MUST respond with error code 501 and MAY respond with error description âdata model not supportedâ if the product does not support the ap-slpf target type
* Upon successful parsing and processing of the âquery ap-slpfâ command, products MUST respond with response code 200 and populate the results field with the ap-slpf-query target type and associated specifiers identified in the command.
* If one or more ip-connection objects were explicitly listed in the allow-rules specifier, then the actuator returns the ip-connection if it is explicitly allowed.  An empty string implies that the ip-connection is not allowed.
* If one or more ip-connection objects were explicitly listed in the deny-rules specifier, then the actuator returns the ip-connection if it is explicitly denied.  An empty string implies that the ip-connection is not denied.
* If no ip-connection objects were explicitly listed in the allow-rules specifier, then the actuator MUST return the complete list of ip-connection objects that are explicitly allowed.
* If no ip-connection objects were explicitly listed in the deny-rules specifier, then the actuator MUST return the complete list of ip-connection objects that are explicitly denied.
* If no specifiers were identified in the query ap-slpf-query command, then the results field MUST return the entire allow and deny list.

Refer to section 4 for sample commands.

# 3 transport
haga transport SHALL be per [Specification for Transfer of OpenC2 Messages via HTTPS Version 1.0 (wip at moment)](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-impl-https/blob/master/oc2-over-https-v1.0-WD01-wip.md).
